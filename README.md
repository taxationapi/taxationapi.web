# Welcome to TaxationAPI.com :)

Taxation API is an open-source project, where we will collect available tax-rates from different countries. This will be exposed in an API everyone can use.

Right now (Nov 12, 2022) this has JUST been started. As all hobby projetcts, use with caution as it's not even ready. Collecting data as we speak.

# How to run projects 

It's a completely standard .NET 7 core API solution. Just open solution and run. No connections or databases, only data-base is a JSON file.

# Your data is wrong

You're VERY welcome to make a pull request. To change data, change it here:
https://github.com/taxationapi/taxationapi.web/blob/main/src/TaxationApi.Web/country_data.json

In your pull request, please explain what it's wrong & preferablyt also add a source.
